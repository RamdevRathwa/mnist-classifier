## 🚀 How to Run the Notebook

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RamdevRathwa/mnist-classifier.git
cd mnist-classifier
```

2. **Set up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
```

3. **Install Required Packages**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

 
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow keras notebook
```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then open `MNIST_Classifier.ipynb` and run all cells to train and test the model.

## 📊 Dataset

We use the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits from 0–9, which is automatically downloaded using `keras.datasets.mnist`.

---

## ✅ Output

- Accuracy score on test dataset.
- Visuals for loss and accuracy.
- Digit predictions.
